<b>1950</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1950.jpg">1950
Formula One officially held its first championship in 1950 and the cars were very different to the cars today. The original F1 design consisted of a 1.5-liter (or less) turbocharged front engine or a 4.5 liter (or less) naturally aspirated engine. The small engine in turn meant a small, narrow body with relatively thin tires. The Alfa Romeo 158 (pictured) was the most successful car at the time.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>1959</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1959.jpg">1959
With increasing competition between teams, engineers began to focus on the overall balance of the car along with creating more powerful engines. In 1959, the British Cooper team placed the engine behind the driver in the middle/rear section of the Cooper T51, which made the front nose more aerodynamic and improved the handling. The width of the tires was also increased. By 1961, every F1 team had caught on and adopted the rear-engine design.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>1962</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1962.jpg">1962
The 1960s saw F1 being dominated by racing cars with a wide, low-slung cigar style which made them more aerodynamic. But Lotus introduced the game-changing "monocoque" structure in 1962 in the Lotus 25 (pictured). With an integrated body and chassis, the car had three times more structural stiffness and weighed half as much as its predecessor. Safety of drivers was also considered with the introduction of rules regarding roll bars above the driver's head and fire protection for fuel tanks.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>1967</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1967.jpg">1967
The cars’ width was increased along with that of the tires to cope with the increase in engine power. Lotus designer Colin Chapman was at the forefront of innovations. He introduced wings to increase downforce in the Lotus 49B and designed engines that were a part of the overall chassis, instead of resting on it.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>1970</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1970.jpg">1970
Chapman once again introduced a bold new shape for the F1 car. The Lotus 72 was wider and had a wedge profile with wings in the front and rear ends of the car – by moving the radiators to the sides – which resulted in even better grip and lesser drag. The tires were made even wider.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>1977</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1977.jpg">1977
Renault entered the sport in 1977 with the first F1 car to be powered by a turbocharged engine. The Renault RS01 produced over 500 bhp but needed a bit of fine-tuning to cope with the different characteristics of the engine and turbo lag (a short delay before the engine could produce its maximum output).
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>1978</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1978.jpg">1978
F1 cars saw the introduction of the revolutionary ground-effect aerodynamics by Chapman which helped to create massive downforce when the cars were at high speeds. The Lotus 78 had an underside which resembled an upturned wing of an aircraft that created an area of low pressure under the car. Along with side skirts, these modifications allowed drivers to take corners at very high speeds.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>1983</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1983.jpg">1983
Ground-effect aerodynamics were banned completely from F1 to curb excessive cornering speeds and make the sport safer, with all cars returning to a flat undertray.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>1988</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1988.jpg">1988
The McLaren team pioneered the lighter and more rigid carbon-fiber chassis in its McLaren MP4/4. It also was the first team to design a car which put the driver in the now-standard reclining position, which helped to reduce the car’s overall drag. The year 1988 was also the last year which permitted turbocharged engines in F1. The technology would later make a comeback in 2014.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>1989</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1989.jpg">1989
In 1989, it was made compulsory for all engines to have a capacity of 3.5 liters. They also had to be naturally aspirated and could between eight to 12 cylinders.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>1992</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1992.jpg">1992
Some form of electronic driver aids were being used in F1 cars during the 1980s, but they started to play a major role in F1 cars in the early 1990s. The Williams FW14B was an advanced car with pre-programmed active suspension and traction control, which made it almost unbeatable on the track.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>1994</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1994.jpg">1994
Electronic driver aids in cars such as active suspension, traction control, launch control and ABS were now banned. F1 also introduced several safety regulations throughout the sport midway through the season after the deaths of drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola, Italy.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>1995</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1995.jpg">1995
Engine capacity of F1 cars was reduced from 3.5 liters to 3 liters to curb speeds and more safety measures around the cockpit to protect the driver were also introduced.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>1998</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/1998.jpg">1998
Speeds came down further as cars became narrower with their width reduced from 2 meters to 1.8 meters. Tires for normal weather running were also required to have grooves from the 1998 season onwards as opposed to, the plain, slick tires.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>2000</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2000.jpg">2000
F1 also specified all cars had to be powered by 3-liter V10, normally aspirated, engines.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>2001</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2001.jpg">2001
Cars were allowed to use traction control as a driver aid again after the governing body FIA admitted it was unable to police whether the teams were using it in some form or another.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>2005</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2005.jpg">2005
In order to make overtaking easier, the dimensions of the cars’ front and rear wings and the nose were changed which affected the aerodynamics of the car.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>2006</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2006.jpg">2006
The capacity of engines was again reduced from 3 liters to 2.4 liters and the number of cylinders also came down from 10 to 8, with V8s being used.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>2008</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2008.jpg">2008
Traction control was banned again after the FIA developed a foolproof method to monitor teams trying to use the driver aid.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>2009</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2009.jpg">2009
Slick tires were allowed once more and the 2009 season also saw the introduction of the kinetic energy recovery system (KERS). KERS is a technology which stores energy generated when a car brakes and then that energy can be used to provide a temporary boost to an engine’s horsepower to help in overtaking.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>2010</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2010.jpg">2010
KERS was not used in the 2010 season since the teams decided they needed more time to develop the system.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>2011</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2011.jpg">2011
The drag reduction system (DRS), a driver adjustable rear wing, was introduced to help overtaking. The KERS system also made a comeback. Regulations for exhaust diffuser systems which helped to increase downforce at the rear of the cars were also put in place.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>2012</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2012.jpg">2012
A change in aerodynamic regulations meant that “step-nose” designs were being used by most teams, which came in for criticism since it reduced the aesthetic appeal of the cars.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>2013</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2013.jpg">2013
In the 2013 season, the FIA allowed the use of panels in order to cover the “step-nose” on the front of the cars, which made the cars more aesthetically pleasing.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>2014</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2014.jpg">2014
The 2014 season saw major changes with teams only allowed to use 1.6-liter, turbocharged V6 engines. A new KERS, known as ERS-K, was introduced with the systems integrated into the engines.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxright">
<b>2015</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2015.jpg">2015
The front nose came in for a redesign due to the tweaking of aerodynamic regulations.
</p>
</div>


<div class="boxleft">
<b>2017</b>
<p><img src="evof1cars/2017.jpg">2017
In order to increase speeds make it more exciting, quite a few changes to the cars’ design have been made. The width of the cars has increased from 1.8 meters to 2 meters and the tires have also been made wider. Both the front and rear wings will be wider, while the exhaust diffuser at the rear has also been increased in size to create more downforce. Shark fin-shaped engine covers at the rear have made a return. The front nose of the cars will be longer too, making the cars look even more aggressive.
